# The built-in Date Object

I re-learnt that it stores dates, times and provides methods for their management and modification.

## Accessing date components

I learnt the methods used for accessing components in the Date object

- date.getMonth() --> returns a number from 0 to 11
- date.getDate() --> returns a number from 0 to 31
- date.getDay() --> returns a number from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday)

# Keyboard Events

Pressing a key always generates a keyboard event, be it symbol keys or special
keys like Shift or Ctrl and so on. When a key on the keyboard is pressed, your browser fires a "keydown" event.
When it is released, you get a "keyup" event. The "keyup" and "keydown" events are _Device-dependent input events_

# Controlled Components

An uncontrolled input has its value implicitly displayed by HTML.
In a controlled component, React tells HTML not to display the value itself. React: "As you get the value from the user input, pass the value to state; I will render it myself from state."

# Math.round()

The Math.round() method rounds a number to the nearest integer

<!-- CSS NOTES -->

# Centering using margin: 0 auto;

Objects can be centered by using margin: 0 auto; if they have are block elements and have a defined width.

# Linear gradient

The linear-gradient() CSS function creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line.
It is used with the background-image property.
